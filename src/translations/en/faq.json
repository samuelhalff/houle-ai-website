    "Subtitle": "Everything you need to know about houle AI solutions for Microsoft 365",
    "LastUpdated": "Last updated",
    "Question1": "What makes houle different from other AI solutions?",
    "Answer1": "We focus exclusively on Microsoft 365 integration with Swiss-hosted AI. Our solutions blend seamlessly into Outlook and Word, where your team already works. Unlike generic AI assistants, we offer complete data sovereignty with Swiss data centers, ensuring your business information never leaves your control.",
    "Question2": "Can you build custom AI applications for our specific needs?",
    "Answer2": "Yes, absolutely. Beyond our ready-to-use add-ins, we develop custom AI solutions tailored to your workflows. From proof-of-concept to production deployment, we handle everything: SharePoint integrations, Power Automate workflows, custom SPFx applications, and Azure-based AI services. Each solution is designed around your business requirements.",
    "Question3": "Is Microsoft 365 compliant with Swiss data protection laws for sensitive professions?",
    "Answer3": "Yes. Swiss courts and the Federal Data Protection Commissioner have confirmed that Microsoft 365 can be used in compliance with Swiss data protection law when properly configured. We ensure your setup meets LPD requirements, with data residency in Swiss Azure regions and appropriate technical measures for regulated industries like healthcare, legal, and finance.",
    "Question4": "What is the typical ROI timeline for AI implementation?",
    "Answer4": "Most clients see measurable productivity gains within 2-3 months. Simple add-ins like email drafting assistants show immediate time savings. Custom workflows and automation projects typically deliver ROI within 6-12 months. We track metrics like time saved per task, error reduction, and process acceleration to quantify impact throughout the project.",
    "Question5": "Do your solutions work offline or require constant internet connection?",
    "Answer5": "Our Office add-ins require internet connectivity to access AI models, as they communicate with Swiss-hosted GPT servers. However, Microsoft 365 apps themselves work offline, and your documents remain accessible. We design solutions to handle intermittent connectivity gracefully, with clear user feedback when AI features are unavailable.",
    "Question6": "How do you handle our proprietary data and business secrets?",
    "Answer6": "Data sovereignty is core to our offering. Your content stays in Swiss data centers, conversations are encrypted in transit and at rest, and we operate under Swiss jurisdiction. Zero-retention policies mean your data is never used for model training. Administrators control exactly what information can be processed by AI and what remains isolated.",
    "Question7": "Can we use our own Azure subscription instead of yours?",
    "Answer7": "Yes, we support both deployment models. You can host everything in your own Azure tenant for maximum control, or use our Swiss-hosted infrastructure for faster setup. For custom solutions, we typically deploy into your Azure environment, giving your IT team full visibility and control over resources, costs, and data flows.",
    "Question8": "What Microsoft 365 license level do we need?",
    "Answer8": "Our add-ins work with Microsoft 365 Business Standard and above. For advanced features like SharePoint Framework customizations or Power Automate premium connectors, you may need E3 or E5 licenses. We audit your existing licenses during the consultation phase and recommend the most cost-effective configuration for your needs.",
    "Question9": "How long does implementation take?",
    "Answer9": "Ready-to-use add-ins can be deployed within days. Custom solutions vary by scope: simple Power Automate workflows take 2-4 weeks, while complex SPFx applications with Azure backend integration require 2-4 months. We provide detailed timelines during the scoping phase and use agile methodologies to deliver value incrementally.",
    "Question10": "Do you provide training for our employees?",
    "Answer10": "Yes, comprehensive training is included. We offer both end-user sessions on how to use the AI tools effectively and administrator training for managing configurations and permissions. Documentation is provided in French, German, and English. For custom solutions, we also train your internal developers to maintain and extend the systems we build.",
    "Question11": "What happens if the AI generates incorrect information?",
    "Answer11": "AI models can make mistakes, which is why we design solutions with appropriate safeguards. Critical workflows include human review steps. We implement confidence scoring, source citation, and validation checkpoints. For sensitive domains like legal or financial content, we recommend AI as an assistant to experts rather than a replacement, with final decisions always made by qualified professionals.",
    "Question12": "Can we integrate with non-Microsoft systems?",
    "Answer12": "Absolutely. While we specialize in Microsoft 365, our solutions integrate with third-party systems through APIs, webhooks, and data connectors. We've built integrations with ERP systems, CRM platforms, accounting software, and industry-specific tools. Azure Logic Apps provides over 400 pre-built connectors, and we develop custom connectors when needed.",
    "Question13": "What about multi-language support?",
    "Answer13": "Our solutions support multiple languages out of the box. The AI models we use handle French, German, Italian, English, and other languages fluently. Swiss multilingual businesses particularly benefit from this, as the same tool can serve teams working in different languages without requiring separate deployments or configurations.",
    "Question14": "How do you handle updates and new AI model versions?",
    "Answer14": "For our managed solutions, we handle model updates transparently. You benefit from improvements in GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and newer models as they become available, without migration projects. For custom deployments in your Azure tenant, we provide update guidance and can perform upgrades during scheduled maintenance windows to avoid disrupting operations.",
    "Question15": "What security certifications do you have?",
    "Answer15": "We operate under Swiss data protection law and follow Microsoft's security best practices for Azure deployments. Our solutions inherit Azure's ISO 27001, SOC 2, and other certifications. For regulated industries, we assist with compliance documentation, audit trails, and technical measures required by FINMA, Swiss healthcare regulations, or legal professional secrecy rules.",
    "Question16": "Can we start with a pilot project before full deployment?",
    "Answer16": "Yes, we strongly recommend this approach. Pilot projects typically run 4-8 weeks with a small group of users. This validates the solution fits your workflows, gathers feedback for refinements, and builds internal champions. Successful pilots make full rollout smoother and help secure stakeholder buy-in with concrete results rather than promises.",
    "Question17": "What ongoing support do you provide after implementation?",
    "Answer17": "We offer flexible support packages from basic email support to dedicated account management. Typical arrangements include monthly check-ins, priority bug fixes, feature enhancements, and proactive monitoring. For mission-critical systems, we provide SLA-backed support with defined response times and escalation procedures.",
    "Question18": "How do you price your solutions?",
    "Answer18": "Pricing depends on scope and deployment model. Ready-to-use add-ins are typically per-user subscriptions. Custom development is project-based or time-and-materials, with fixed-price options for well-defined scopes. Swiss GPT platform access is billed by usage (tokens processed) or flat monthly fees for predictable budgeting. We provide detailed quotes after the initial consultation.",
    "Question19": "Are your solutions compatible with government and public sector requirements?",
    "Answer19": "Yes, many of our clients are Swiss public entities. We address specific requirements like Swiss cloud data residency, accessibility standards, multilingual interfaces, and procurement compliance. Our solutions can be deployed in isolated environments when required and documentation is provided for security assessments and regulatory filings.",
    "Question20": "What if we're not satisfied with the solution?",
    "Answer20": "We work iteratively with regular feedback loops to ensure satisfaction. Pilot projects include refinement cycles before full commitment. For subscription services, contracts typically allow cancellation with 30-60 days notice. For custom development, we use milestone-based payment structures where you only pay for completed, accepted work. Your success is our success."
