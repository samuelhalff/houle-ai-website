        "Intro": "Companies using Microsoft 365 often leverage only a fraction of the possibilities offered by this platform. Between Power Automate for automation, SharePoint for document management, Power BI for data analysis and SPFx for application development, the Microsoft ecosystem offers powerful tools that remain underused. We support you to fully exploit these technologies and transform how you work.",

Power Automate can automate hundreds of repetitive tasks, SharePoint can structure and secure all your business information, Power BI can transform your data into interactive dashboards, and SPFx allows you to create custom applications perfectly integrated. The return on investment is quick because you are using tools you already own."
